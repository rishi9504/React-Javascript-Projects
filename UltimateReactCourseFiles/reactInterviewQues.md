For a React developer interview, interview questions will focus on **core React concepts, performance optimization, state management, design patterns, and best practices**. Here’s a structured list:  

---

### **1. React Fundamentals**  
#### What are the differences between **functional** and **class components**?  
##### **Functional vs. Class Components in React**  

Both **functional** and **class** components are used to build React applications, but they have key differences in syntax, performance, and how they handle state and lifecycle methods.

---

##### **1. Syntax**  
- **Functional Components** are plain JavaScript functions that return JSX.  
- **Class Components** are ES6 classes that extend `React.Component`.  

##### **Example of a Functional Component**  
```jsx
function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```

##### **Example of a Class Component**  
```jsx
class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
  }
}
```

---

##### **2. State Management**  
- **Functional Components** (before hooks) were **stateless**. However, with **React Hooks**, they can now use `useState` for managing state.  
- **Class Components** use `this.state` to manage state and `this.setState` to update it.  

##### **Example of State in Functional Component (using Hooks)**  
```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

##### **Example of State in Class Component**  
```jsx
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
          Increment
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

---

##### **3. Lifecycle Methods vs. Hooks**  
- **Class Components** use lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.  
- **Functional Components** use `useEffect` to achieve the same functionality.  

##### **Example in Class Component**  
```jsx
class Example extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    console.log("Component mounted!");
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    console.log("Component will unmount!");
  }

  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
  }
}
```

##### **Same Example Using Functional Component with Hooks**  
```jsx
import { useEffect } from "react";

function Example() {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Component mounted!");

    return () => {
      console.log("Component will unmount!");
    };
  }, []);

  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}
```

---

##### **4. Performance**  
- **Functional Components** are **lighter and faster** because they don’t have the overhead of `this` and lifecycle methods.  
- **Class Components** can cause **performance issues** due to frequent re-renders and complex state handling.  

---

##### **5. Code Readability & Maintainability**  
- Functional components with hooks **reduce boilerplate code** and are easier to read.  
- Class components have more **verbose** code with `this` bindings and lifecycle methods.  

---

##### **6. "this" Keyword Usage**  
- **Functional Components** do not use `this`.  
- **Class Components** require `this` to access props and state, which can be confusing and require manual binding.  

```jsx
class Example extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }

  handleClick() {
    console.log("Button clicked!");
  }

  render() {
    return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click me</button>;
  }
}
```
In functional components, you don't need `bind`:
```jsx
function Example() {
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log("Button clicked!");
  };

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;
}
```

---

##### **7. Adoption & Future of React**  
- Functional components with hooks are now the **preferred way** to write React components.  
- React **recommends** using functional components whenever possible.  

---

##### **Summary Table**  

| Feature                | Functional Components | Class Components |
|------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Syntax**             | Simple functions     | ES6 classes     |
| **State**              | `useState` Hook      | `this.state`    |
| **Lifecycle Methods**  | `useEffect` Hook     | `componentDidMount`, etc. |
| **Performance**        | Faster, no `this` overhead | Slightly slower |
| **Readability**        | Cleaner, less boilerplate | More complex, requires `this` |
| **Recommended**        | ✅ Yes, preferred | ❌ No, legacy |

##### **Conclusion**  
Functional components with hooks are the **modern standard** in React. They are easier to write, more readable, and perform better than class components. **Class components are still supported** but are considered outdated for new React projects.
